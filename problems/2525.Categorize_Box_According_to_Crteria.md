## Problem Description

Given four integers length, width, height, and mass, representing the dimensions and mass of a box, respectively, return a string representing the **category** of the box.

The box is `"Bulky"` if:  </br>
**Any** of the dimensions of the box is greater or equal to $10^4$.  </br>
Or, the **volume** of the box is greater or equal to $109$.  </br>
If the mass of the box is greater or equal to 100, it is `"Heavy"`.  </br>
If the box is both "Bulky" and "Heavy", then its category is `"Both"`.  </br>
If the box is neither "Bulky" nor "Heavy", then its category is `"Neither"`.  </br>
If the box is "Bulky" but not "Heavy", then its category is "Bulky".  </br>
If the box is "Heavy" but not "Bulky", then its category is "Heavy".  </br>
Note that the volume of the box is the product of its length, width and height.



## Approach
很簡單的題目，好像沒有什麼需要特別加註的地方。真要說的說是條件句的順序吧。最小的要放最上面，
因此第一個條件是 $A \bigcap B$，然後才是條件 A、條件 B。

<br>

This is a straightforward problem that doesn't seem to require much additional explanation. If I had to point something out, it would be the order of the conditional checks. The most restrictive condition (both Bulky and Heavy) should be checked first, followed by the individual conditions (Bulky or Heavy).

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def categorizeBox(self, length: int, width: int, height: int, mass: int) -> str:
        def Bulky_check(l,w,h):
            if l*w*h >= 10**9 or max(l,w,h) >= 10**4:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        
        def Heavy_check(mass):
            if mass >= 100:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        
        if Bulky_check(length,width,height) == True and Heavy_check(mass) == True:
            return "Both"
        elif Bulky_check(length,width,height) == True:
            return "Bulky"
        elif Heavy_check(mass) == True:
            return "Heavy"
        else:
            return "Neither"
