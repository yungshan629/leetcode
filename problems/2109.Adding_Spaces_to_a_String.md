https://leetcode.com/problems/adding-spaces-to-a-string/

## Problem Description

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a **0-indexed** integer array `spaces` that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each space should be inserted **before** the character at the given index.

- For example, given `s = "EnjoyYourCoffee"` and `spaces = [5, 9]`, we place spaces before `'Y'` and `'C'`, which are at indices `5` and `9` respectively. Thus, we obtain `"Enjoy Your Coffee"`.

Return *the modified string **after** the spaces have been added.*

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "LeetcodeHelpsMeLearn", spaces = [8,13,15]  <br>
**Output:** "Leetcode Helps Me Learn"  <br>
**Explanation:**  <br>
The indices 8, 13, and 15 correspond to the underlined characters in "LeetcodeHelpsMeLearn".  <br>
We then place spaces before those characters.

## Approach
1. 依據題目給定的spaces, 將 s 分割成各子字串的 list 列表.
2. 用空白將所有子字串連接接起來

<br>

1. According to the given spaces array, split string s into a list of substrings.
2. Join all substrings together using spaces as separators.

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def addSpaces(self, s: str, spaces: List[int]) -> str:
        index = 0
        result = []

        for i in spaces:
            result.append(s[index : i])
            
            index = i
        
        result.append(s[index:])
        return " ".join(result)
```

Java Code:

```

```
