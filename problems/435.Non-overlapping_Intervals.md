## Problem Description

Given an array of `intervals` intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.*

**Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.


**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]  <br>
**Output:** 1  <br>
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.


## Approach

1. 首先對區間進行排序，以終點作為排序依據，如此可確保移除時是移除較大的區間(移除最少區間)。
2. 逐步搜尋，若起點大於前一個區間終點，表示兩個區間有重疊，必須移除。若無，移動終點為最後一個區間的終點。

<br>

1. First, sort the intervals by their end points. This ensures we remove larger intervals when removing is necessary (minimizing the number of removals).
2. Search through the sorted intervals. If the start point is greater than the previous interval's end point, it indicates an overlap and we must remove the interval. If there's no overlap, update the end point to be the last interval's end point.

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals_sort = sorted(intervals, key = lambda intervals : intervals[1])
        n=len(intervals_sort)
        count = 0
        last_end = -inf

        for i in range(n):
            if intervals_sort[i][0] < last_end:
                count += 1
            else:
                last_end = intervals_sort[i][1]

        return count
```

Java Code:

```
