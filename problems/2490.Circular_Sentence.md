## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-sentence/

## Problem Description

A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces.

For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences.
Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is **circular** if:

The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.
For example, `"leetcode exercises sound delightful"`, `"eetcode`", `"leetcode eats soul"` are all circular sentences. 
However, `"Leetcode is cool"`, `"happy Leetcode"`, `"Leetcode"` and `"I like Leetcode"` are **not** circular sentences.

Given a string `sentence`, return `true` *if it is circular*. Otherwise, return `false`.



## Approach
很簡單的題目。搜尋第一個字母和最後一個字母，判斷是否相同。搜尋空格，判斷前一個字母和後一個字母是否相同。

<br>

To solve this problem, we'll:
* Compare the first and last letters of the entire sentence.
* Check if the last letter of each word matches the first letter of the next word.

        for i in range(len(sentence)):
            if sentence[i] == " ":
