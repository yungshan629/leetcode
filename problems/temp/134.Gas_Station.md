## Problem Description

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the $i^{th}$ station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the $i^{th}$ station to its next $(i + 1)^{th}$ station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return *the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return* `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input**: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]  <br>
**Output**: 3  <br>
**Explanation**:  <br>
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4  <br>
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8  <br>
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7  <br>
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6  <br>
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5  <br>
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.  <br>
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.



## Approach
我想的比較複雜。先說明我根據題意推導出的計算方式，再說明其他人簡化後的比較快速的計算方式。
1. 先排除不可能走完的情形：如果整趟旅程能加到的油 < 整趟旅程的耗油量，注定無法繞完一圈。
2. 由於是要繞一圈，為方便計算，將 gas - cost後，再序列頭尾相接延長，如此可減少走到底後要從0開始的麻煩。
3. 如果一開始能加到的油 > 耗油，勢必無法出發。因此尋找 remaining > 0 的位置為可能的起始點。

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(gas)
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost) : return -1
        elif n == 1 : return 0
     
        remaining = [gas[i] - cost[i] for i in range(n)]
        remaining += remaining

        start = [i for i in range(n) if remaining[i] > 0]
        start.reverse()

        for i in start:
          tank =0
          for j in range(i, n+i):
            tank += remaining[j]
            
            if tank < 0:
              break
            elif j == n+i-1 and tank >=0:
              return i
        return -1
```
