## Problem Description

You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

Return *a list of integers representing the size of these parts*.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"  <br>
**Output:** [9,7,8]  <br>
**Explanation:**  <br>
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".  <br>
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.  <br>
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.


## Approach
第一步建立字典應該是最重要的步驟，其餘步驟都是可以想出來的。


## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        last = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        seen_chars = []
        result = []
        latest_position = 0
        n = len(s)

        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] not in seen_chars:
                if last[s[i]] == i and len(seen_chars) == 0:
                    result.append(i+1)
                else:
                    seen_chars.append(s[i])
                    latest_position = max( last[s[i]], latest_position)

            else:
                if i == latest_position:
                    seen_chars = []
                    result.append(i+1)

        
        for j in range(len(result)-1,0,-1):
            result[j] = result[j] - result[j-1]
        
        return result
```
