## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/

## Problem Description

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the $i^{th}$ person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return *the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** people = [1,2], limit = 3  <br>
**Output:** 1  <br>
**Explanation:** 1 boat (1, 2)



## Approach

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        l, r = 0, len(people) - 1
        count = 0

        while l < r:
            if people[l] + people[r] <= limit: 
                l += 1
                r -= 1
                count += 1
            elif people[l] + people[r] > limit and people[r] <= limit:
                r -= 1                
                count += 1

        
        if l == r:
            return count + 1
        else:
            return count
```

Java Code:
