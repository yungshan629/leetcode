## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/

## Problem Description

You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

- `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the $i^{th}$ job, and
- `worker[j]` is the ability of $j^{th}$ worker (i.e., the $j^{th}$ worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[j]`).

Every worker can be assigned **at most one job**, but one job can be **completed multiple times.**

- For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays `$1`, then the total profit will be `$3`. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is `$0`.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]  <br>
**Output:** 100  <br>
**Explanation:** Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.



## Approach

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfitAssignment(self, difficulty: List[int], profit: List[int], worker: List[int]) -> int:
        total_profit = 0
        i_d = len(difficulty) - 1
        i_w = len(worker) - 1
        worker.sort()
        sorted_profit, sorted_diff = zip(*sorted(zip(profit, difficulty)))
        
        while i_w > -1:
            if sorted_diff[i_d] > worker[i_w]:
                i_d -= 1
                if i_d < 0:
                    return total_profit
            else:
                total_profit += sorted_profit[i_d]
                i_w -= 1
        
        return total_profit
```
