## Problem Description

Given an array of `intervals` intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.*

**Note** that intervals which only touch at a point are **non-overlapping**. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.


**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]  <br>
**Output:** 1  <br>
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.


## Approach



## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals_sort = sorted(intervals, key = lambda intervals : intervals[1])
        n=len(intervals_sort)
        count = 0
        last_end = -inf

        for i in range(n):
            if intervals_sort[i][0] < last_end:
                count += 1
            else:
                last_end = intervals_sort[i][1]

        
        return count
```

Java Code:

```

```
