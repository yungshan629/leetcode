https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-word-occurs-as-a-prefix-of-any-word-in-a-sentence/

## Problem Description

Given a `sentence` that consists of some words separated by a **single space**, and a `searchWord`, check if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in `sentence`.

Return the index of the word in `sentence` (**1-indexed**) *where `searchWord` is a prefix of this word*. If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word **(minimum index)**. If there is no such word return `-1`.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"  <br>
**Output:** 4  <br>
**Explanation:** "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

        n1 = len(searchWord)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if searchWord == word_list[i][0:n1]:
                return i+1
        
        return -1
