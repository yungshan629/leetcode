## Problem Description

You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a **circular** array `code` 
of length of `n` and a key `k`.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced **simultaneously**.

* If `k > 0`, replace the $i^{th}$ number with the sum of the **next** `k` numbers.
* If `k < 0`, replace the $i^{th}$ number with the sum of the **previous** `k` numbers.
* If `k == 0`, replace the $i^{th}$ number with `0`.
As `code` is circular, the next element of `code[n-1]` is `code[0]`, and the previous element of `code[0]` is `code[n-1]`.

Given the **circular** array `code` and an integer key `k`, return *the decrypted code to defuse the bomb*!

**Example 1:**

**Input:** code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3  <br>
**Output:** [12,10,16,13]  <br>
**Explanation:** Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.



## Approach

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def decrypt(self, code: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(code)
        new_code = []
        code = code + code

        if k == 0:
            new_code = [ 0 for i in range(n)]
        elif k > 0:
            for i in range(n):
                new_code.append(sum(code[i+1:i+k+1]))
        else:
            for i in range(n,2*n):
                new_code.append(sum(code[i+k:i]))

        return new_code
```

Java Code:

```

```
