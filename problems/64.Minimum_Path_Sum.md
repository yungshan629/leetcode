https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/

## Problem Description

Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.


## Approach

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        for i in range(1,m):
            grid[i][0] += grid[i-1][0]
        for j in range(1,n):
            grid[0][j] += grid[0][j-1]

        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                if grid[i-1][j] < grid[i][j-1]:
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i-1][j]
                else:
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i][j-1]

        return grid[-1][-1]
```
