## Problem Description

Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]  <br>
**Output:** 7  <br>
**Explanation:** Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.


## Approach
1. 初始化邊界：每個格子是前一格的值加上當前值
2. 其餘格子：
   - 在上方或左方中，找到最小路徑
   - 當前格子的值加上最小值
3. grid[-1][-1] 即為最小路徑和

<br>

1. Initialize the boundaries: Each cell is the sum of the previous cell plus the current value
2. For remaining cells:
   - Find the minimum path between the cell above or to the left
   - Add the current cell's value to this minimum
3. grid[-1][-1] gives us the minimum path sum


## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        for i in range(1,m):
            grid[i][0] += grid[i-1][0]
        for j in range(1,n):
            grid[0][j] += grid[0][j-1]

        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                if grid[i-1][j] < grid[i][j-1]:
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i-1][j]
                else:
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i][j-1]

        return grid[-1][-1]
```
