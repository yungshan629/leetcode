## Problem Description

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the $i^{th}$ station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the $i^{th}$ station to its next $(i + 1)^{th}$ station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return *the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return* `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input**: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]  <br>
**Output**: 3  <br>
**Explanation**:  <br>
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4  <br>
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8  <br>
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7  <br>
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6  <br>
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5  <br>
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.  <br>
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.



## Approach
我想的比較複雜。先說明我根據題意推導出的計算方式，再說明其他人簡化後的比較快速的計算方式。
1. 先排除不可能走完的情形：如果整趟旅程能加到的油 < 整趟旅程的耗油量，注定無法繞完一圈。
2. 由於是要繞一圈，為方便計算，將 gas - cost後，再序列頭尾相接延長，如此可減少走到底後要從0開始的麻煩。
3. 如果一開始能加到的油 < 耗油，勢必無法出發。因此尋找 remaining > 0 的位置為可能的起始點。
4. 每前進一格便計算剩餘油量，要是剩餘油量小於 0，表示無法走完全程。要是走完全程剩餘油量大於等於0，表示此次出發點即是所求。

題目有說，排除不可能到的情況，一定會有一個唯一解，此條件可用來簡化檢查過程。
1. 從 0 開始出發，如果能走到終點，則0即為所求。如果中途出現剩餘油量 < 0，則排除此點，檢視下一個點。
2. 依序檢查 1、2、3點，如果一樣無法走到終點，則同樣排除。
3. 若0、1、2、3皆排除，只須檢查 4、5、6 能不能走到 n 即可，不用繞一圈，因為題目確定會有一解。
4. 若 1~n 皆排除，則 n 必然是該唯一解。

My Approach:

1. Eliminate Impossible Scenarios: If the total gas available is less than the total cost, it's impossible to complete the circuit.
2. Circular Calculation: To simplify calculations, we concatenate the gas - cost sequence, creating a circular array. This avoids the need to handle the end-of-array edge case.
3. Find Potential Starting Points: We identify potential starting points where the remaining gas is positive.
4. Iterative Check: For each potential starting point, we simulate the journey, calculating the remaining gas at each station. If the remaining gas ever becomes negative, we discard the starting point. If we complete the full circle with non-negative remaining gas, we've found the solution.

Simplified Approach:

1. Start from 0: We start from the 0th station and simulate the journey. If we can reach the end, 0 is the solution.
2. Check Subsequent Stations: If 0 fails, we check 1, 2, and so on.  There's no need to complete a full circle since we know there must be a solution.
3. Early Termination: Since the problem guarantees a unique solution, we can terminate early if we find a valid starting point or if we've exhausted all possibilities.

By leveraging the problem's guarantee of a unique solution, we can optimize the checking process and avoid unnecessary iterations.

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(gas)
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost) : return -1
        elif n == 1 : return 0
     
        remaining = [gas[i] - cost[i] for i in range(n)]
        remaining += remaining

        start = [i for i in range(n) if remaining[i] > 0]
        start.reverse()

        for i in start:
          tank =0
          for j in range(i, n+i):
            tank += remaining[j]
            
            if tank < 0:
              break
            elif j == n+i-1 and tank >=0:
              return i
        return -1
```

更簡潔的算法：
```py
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(gas)
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost) : return -1
        elif n == 1 : return 0
     
        start, tank = 0, 0
        for i in range(n):
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if tank < 0:
                start = i + 1
                tank = 0
        return start        
```
