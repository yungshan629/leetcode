## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` *if and only if* `s` *can become* `goal` *after some number of **shifts** on* `s`.

A **shift** on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position.

* For example, if `s = "abcde"`, then it will be `"bcdea"` after one shift.

 
**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"  <br>
**Output:** true


## Approach
1. 搜尋並收集所有可能位移的位數
2. 依次位移並比對，若出現和 goal 相同的結果即回報 True。若嘗試所有可能皆不符合則回報 False。

<br>

1. Identify potential shift positions: I search for all possible starting positions in the goal string where the first character of s could align.
2. Perform shifts and compare: For each identified position, I shift the characters of s accordingly and compare the resulting string with goal.
3. Return result: If a match is found, I return True; otherwise, I return False after exhausting all possibilities.


## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def rotateString(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        index = []
        for i in range(len(goal)):
            if s[0] == goal[i]:
                index.append(i)
            
        for j in index:
            new_s = s[-j:] + s[:-j]
            if new_s == goal:
                return True
        
        return False
