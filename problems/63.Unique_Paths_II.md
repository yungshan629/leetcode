## Problem Description

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

Example 1:

Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right



## Approach
這一題是 #62 的延伸題，概念上相同，到達當前位置的路徑數，是由左邊和上面加總而得。
1. 建立二維 dp 陣列，由於有障礙物，因此初始化為 0，只將起點設為 1 (若起點是障礙物，則直接返回 0)
2. 先處理第一行和第一列:
   - 如果當前格子不是障礙物，則路徑數等於前一格的路徑數
   - 如果是障礙物，保持為 0，且後續格子都無法到達
3. 處理其他格子：
   - 如果當前位置是空格(0)，則路徑數 = 上方路徑數 + 左方路徑數
   - 如果當前位置是障礙物(1)，則路徑數 = 0
4. 最右下角的值即為所有可能的路徑數總量。

<br>

1. Create a 2D dp array. Due to obstacles, initialize all cells as 0, and set starting point as 1 (if starting point is an obstacle, return 0 directly)
2. First handle the first row and column.
   - If current cell is not an obstacle, paths equal to previous cell's paths;
   - If it's an obstacle, keep it as 0, and all subsequent cells become unreachable.
3. Process other cells:
   - If current position is empty(0), paths = paths from above + paths from left;
   - If current position is an obstacle(1), paths = 0.
4. The value at bottom-right corner represents the total number of possible paths.


## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
  def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    if not obstacleGrid or obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])

    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
    dp[0][0] = 1

    for i in range(1,m):
        if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0:
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]

    for j in range(1,n):
        if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0:
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]
    
    for i in range(1,m):
        for j in range(1,n):
            if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

    print(dp)
    
    return dp[-1][-1]
```
