## Problem Description

```
Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division,
and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example,
8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed
integer range: [−231, 231 − 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then
return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.

Example 1:

Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
```

## Approach
1. 題目要求不能用乘法、除法、餘數函數等操作，換言之，只能用加、減法。因此，得用連續減來實現除法。
2. 將除數及被除數都換成正整數，比較好計算。負號在最後的時候還原就好。

## Code

- Support Language: Java,Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def divide(self, dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:

        def divid(x,y):
            if x < y:
                return 0, x
            else:
                diff = x - y
                quotient=1
                while diff >= y:
                    diff -= y
                    quotient +=1
                remainder = diff
                return quotient, remainder

        abs_dividend = abs(dividend)
        abs_divisor = abs(divisor) 

        if dividend == 0 or abs_dividend < abs_divisor:
            return 0    
        if divisor == -1 and dividend == -2**31 :
            return 2**31 - 1
              
        num_list = [int(digit) for digit in str(abs_dividend)]
        
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(num_list)):
            l, m = divid(num_list[i], abs_divisor)
            if m != 0 and i < len(num_list)-1:
                num_list[i+1] += 10*m
            result = 10*result + l

        if dividend * divisor < 0:
            result = -result
              
        return result
```
