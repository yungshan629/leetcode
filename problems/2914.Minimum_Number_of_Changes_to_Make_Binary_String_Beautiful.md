## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-changes-to-make-binary-string-beautiful/

## Problem Description

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string s having an even length.

A string is **beautiful** if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

* Each substring has an **even length.**
* Each substring contains **only** `1`'s or **only** `0`'s.

You can change any character in `s` to `0` or `1`.

Return the ***minimum** number of changes required to make the string `s` beautiful*.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "1001"  <br>
**Output:** 2  <br>
**Explanation:** We change s[1] to 1 and s[3] to 0 to get string "1100".  <br>
It can be seen that the string "1100" is beautiful because we can partition it into "11|00".  <br>
It can be proven that 2 is the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.
