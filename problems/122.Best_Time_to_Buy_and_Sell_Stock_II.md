## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the $i^{th}$ day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return *the **maximum** profit you can achieve*.

</br>

**Example 1:**  

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]  </br>
**Output:** 7  </br>
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. </br>
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3. </br>
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
