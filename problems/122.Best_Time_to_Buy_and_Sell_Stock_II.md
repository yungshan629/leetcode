## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the $i^{th}$ day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return *the **maximum** profit you can achieve*.

</br>

**Example 1:**  

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]  </br>
**Output:** 7  </br>
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. </br>
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3. </br>
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.



## Approach
和 121 有些類似，不過允許多次買進賣出。
這一題比想像中的簡單，關鍵在於你可以在同一天買跟賣，換句話說，可以昨天買、今天賣，這樣只需要逐天分析就好，不需要找最好的買賣點。
1. 如果明天的價格比今天高，則選擇今天買入明天賣出。
2. 以此類推，將每日報酬加總。

<br>

The problem is simpler than it seems. Since you can buy and sell on the same day, we only need to focus on daily price fluctuations. We can achieve maximum profit by buying on days when the price is lower and selling on days when the price is higher.

1. Iterate over the prices: For each day, if the price of the next day is higher, we can buy on the current day and sell on the next day.
2. Calculate the profit: Add the profit from each transaction to the total profit.



## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)-1):
            if prices[i] < prices[i+1]:
                profit += prices[i+1] - prices[i]
        return profit
```
