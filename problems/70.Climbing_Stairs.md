## Problem Description

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2  <br>
**Output:** 2  <br>
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top.  <br>
1. 1 step + 1 step  <br>
2. 2 steps  <br>


## Approach
這是排列的問題，如果要詳細解釋得從數學講起了。簡單說，先將其視為解 $2x + y = n$ 的問題，
找出 $(x, y)$ 的配對，再根據每個配對記算有多少種排列，最後加總所有結果。

<br>

This is a permutation problem. A detailed explanation would require starting from mathematical principles. To put it simply, we:

* First treat it as solving the equation $2x + y = n$
* Find all possible pairs of $(x, y)$
* Calculate the number of permutations for each pair
* Sum up all the results


## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
from math import comb

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for x in range(int(n/2)+1):
          y = n - 2*x
          count += math.comb(x + y,y)
        
        return count
```

Java Code:

```
