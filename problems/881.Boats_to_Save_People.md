## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/

## Problem Description

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the $i^{th}$ person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return *the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** people = [1,2], limit = 3  <br>
**Output:** 1  <br>
**Explanation:** 1 boat (1, 2)



## Approach
1. 使用排序將體重由小到大排列，便於使用雙指針策略
2. 左指針(l)指向最輕的人，右指針(r)指向最重的人
3. 當左指針小於右指針時：
    - 如果最輕和最重的人總重不超過限制，可以同乘一艇，兩個指針都移動
    - 如果總重超過限制但最重的人未超重，最重的人單獨一艇，右指針左移
4. 特殊情況：
    - 當左右指針相遇時，表示還剩一人未分配，需要多加一艇
    - 如果指針未相遇，直接返回已計算的艇數

<br>

1. Sort people's weights in ascending order to facilitate the two-pointer strategy
2. Left pointer (l) points to the lightest person, right pointer (r) points to the heaviest person
3. While left pointer is less than right pointer:
    - If the sum of lightest and heaviest weights doesn't exceed the limit, they can share a boat, move both pointers
    - If the sum exceeds the limit but the heaviest person is within limit, assign a boat to the heaviest person, move right pointer left
4. Special cases:
    - When left and right pointers meet, one person remains unassigned, need to add one more boat
    - If pointers don't meet, return the current boat count

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        l, r = 0, len(people) - 1
        count = 0

        while l < r:
            if people[l] + people[r] <= limit: 
                l += 1
                r -= 1
                count += 1
            elif people[l] + people[r] > limit and people[r] <= limit:
                r -= 1                
                count += 1

        
        if l == r:
            return count + 1
        else:
            return count
```
