https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

## Problem Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the $i^{th}$ day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1**:

**Input**: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]  </br>
**Output**: 5  </br>
**Explanation**: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.  </br>
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
