## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the **longest**
*palindrome* that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abccccdd"  <br>
**Output:** 7  <br>
**Explanation:** One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.



## Approach
Python有個非常好用的 Counter() 函數，只要利用 Counter() 函數，再將其計算字母出現的次數依偶數、奇數分開計算加總，即可獲得答案。

<br>

Python's Counter() function is very useful for this problem. By using Counter() to count the occurrences of each letter, we can separate the counts into even and odd groups. The final result is the sum of the even counts plus the sum of the odd counts (with an adjustment for a single odd count if it exists).

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        s_dict=Counter(s)
        even_sum, odd_sum, count = 0, 0, 0
         
        for k, v in s_dict.items():
            if v % 2 == 0:
                even_sum += v
            else:
                odd_sum += v -1
                count = 1

        if count == 1: 
            odd_sum += 1

        return odd_sum + even_sum


```
