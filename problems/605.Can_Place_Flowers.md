## Problem Description

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot 
be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, 
and an integer `n`, return `true` *if `n` new flowers can be planted in the* `flowerbed` *without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and* `false` *otherwise.*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1  <br>
**Output:** true

## Approach
這題的概念上不難，問題只是在於怎麼實現。按題意，必須要有連續空位才能種花，連續3個或4個空位能種1朵花，
連續5個或6個空位能種2朵子，連續7個或8個空位能種3朵花，以此類推。邊界的話，只要計算時多算一個空位，
就能和一般情況銜接了。
1. 先計算連續的空位數（0的數量）
2. 對於位於開頭或結尾的空位，因為只需要考慮一側是否有花，所以計算時多給2個空位
3. 對於中間的空位，則每個空位計1個位置
4. 當遇到已種花的位置（1）或到達陣列尾端時，就用公式 (count-1)/2 計算在這段連續空位中最多能種幾朵花
5. 最後將所有可種花的數量加總，如果大於或等於所需種植的花數(n)，就回傳 True

This problem is conceptually straightforward, with the main challenge lying in its implementation. According to the requirements, flowers can only be planted in consecutive empty plots: 3 or 4 consecutive empty plots can accommodate 1 flower, 5 or 6 consecutive empty plots can fit 2 flowers, 7 or 8 consecutive empty plots can hold 3 flowers, and so on. For boundary cases, we can simply add an extra empty plot in our calculations to align with the general case.
For the implementation:

1. First, count consecutive empty plots (number of 0s)
2. For empty plots at the start or end of the array, add 2 to the count since we only need to consider flowers on one side
3. For empty plots in the middle, count each as 1 position
4. When encountering a planted position (1) or reaching the end of the array, use the formula (count-1)/2 to calculate how many flowers can be planted in this consecutive empty segment
5. Finally, sum up all possible flower placements, and return True if the sum is greater than or equal to the required number of flowers (n)

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        n_fl = len(flowerbed)

        if n_fl == 1 and flowerbed[0] == 0:
            return True

        count = 0
        flower = []
        for i in range(n_fl):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                if i == 0 or i == n_fl - 1:
                    count += 2
                else:
                    count += 1
            elif flowerbed[i]!=0 and count != 0:
                flower.append((count-1)//2)
                count = 0
        
        if count != 0:
            flower.append((count-1)//2)

        return sum(flower) >= n
