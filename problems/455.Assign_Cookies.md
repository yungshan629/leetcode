## Problem Description

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child 
will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the
cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]  <br>
**Output:** 1  <br>
**Explanation:** You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.

## Approach
1. 排序兩個陣列，如此可以按順序配對。
2. 1個指針追蹤小孩，1個指針追蹤餅乾
3. 如果當前的餅乾可以滿足當前的孩子，則移動孩子的指針。
4. 無論是否滿足，都移動餅乾的指針。

<br>

1. Sort both arrays so we can match them in order.
2. Use one pointer to track children and another pointer to track cookies.
3. If the current cookie can satisfy the current child, move the child pointer.
4. Whether satisfied or not, always move the cookie pointer.

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        ns = len(s)
        ng = len(g)
        if ns ==0 or ng == 0 or max(s) < min(g):
            return 0

        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        child = 0
        cookie = 0

        while child < ng and cookie < ns:
            if s[cookie] >= g[child]:
                child += 1
            cookie += 1
            
        return child
```
