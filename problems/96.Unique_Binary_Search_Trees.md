## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, return *the number of structurally unique **BST**'s 
(binary search trees) which has exactly `n` nodes of unique values from `1` to `n`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3  <br>
**Output:** 5

## Approach

å
## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1

        for i in range(2,n+1):
            for j in range(i):
                dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i-1-j]
        
        return dp[-1]
```

Java Code:
