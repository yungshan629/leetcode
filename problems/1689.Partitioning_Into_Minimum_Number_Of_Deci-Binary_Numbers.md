## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/partitioning-into-minimum-number-of-deci-binary-numbers/

## Problem Description

A decimal number is called **deci-binary** if each of its digits is either `0` or `1` without any leading zeros. For example, `101` and `1100` are **deci-binary**, while `112` and `3001` are not.

Given a string `n` that represents a positive decimal integer, return *the **minimum** number of positive **deci-binary** numbers needed so that they sum up to `n`.*

**Example 1:**

**Input**: n = "32"  </br>
**Output**: 3  </br>
**Explanation:** 10 + 11 + 11 = 32



## Approach
這題用 python 解好像有點不公平，內建的函數太強大了，一行就解決。
因為只能用0、1構成，因此原字串中出現的最大個位數，就是最小構成的數字。

It seems a bit unfair to solve this problem using Python because its built-in functions are so powerful that a single line can solve it. Since only 0s and 1s can be used, the largest digit in the original string is the minimum number of constituent numbers.

## Code

- Support Language: Java, Python

Python Code:

```py
class Solution:
    def minPartitions(self, n: str) -> int:
        return int(max(n))
```

Java Code:

```

```
